1. Inside of this code, I firstly produce gamma at a specific energy(519.9keV, Ordinary Muon Capture for the 48Ti target) uniformly from cubic, then I can check how many full energy peak in the HPGe detector

2. Maybe the code from /home/iktp/Geant4-Work/NewStart/CodeBefore20230627 is useful for future use,
